<p>While I was working on <a href="../muse/app.html">Muse,</a> I ran into a fun problem. The application relied heavily on everyone's x and y coordinates and since most people's screens were different sizes this meant that other people's mouse pointers would display in the wrong locations.</p>
<p>To fix this I realized that I needed some way to scale everyone's coordinates to a default scale. It ended up being the same equation I use to figure out what grade I got out of 100 when getting an exam out of 130 or 47.</p>
<h3>The Equation</h3>
<div class="math text-center" style="margin-bottom: 10px">
    <div style="padding-bottom: 10px">
        \(Scaling: coordinate * {default scale \over current scale}\)
    </div>
    <div>
        \(Descaling: coordinate / {default scale \over current scale}\)
    </div>

</div>
<p>
    Simple enough, and it works. So for the application I used that to transfer scaled coordinates and unscale coordinates the client received.
</p>
<p> As an example: converting a 9/10 to an out of 100 scale:<br>
    \(Sending: 9 * {100 \over 10} = 90\)<br>
    \(Receiving: 90 / {100 \over 10} = 9\)
</p>
<h3>Sending</h3>
<pre class="lang-c"><code>socket.emit('mouseCoord',  {
    x: mouse.x * (2000/windowWidth),
    y: mouse.y * (2000/windowHeight)
};</code></pre>
<h3>Receiving</h3>
<pre class="lang-c"><code>updateCursor(
    data.x/(2000/windowWidth),
    data.y/(2000/windowHeight)
    );</code></pre>
</pre>
